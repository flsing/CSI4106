Kaggle PUBG Placement Prediction Competition

## Information 

Kaggle compitition completed by Felix Singerman, Patrick Langis, and Diego Pontones. 
The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of "The Blue Circle." This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made possible through the PUBG Developer API.

You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings. 

## Installation 

Make your way to the directory that contains the project. 

Download the data files from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data) and save them under a directory called "data"

You then have to enter the Virtual Environment 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

In order to set up the environment you need to do the following command once you are in the venv. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, open the notebook  


```
jupyter notebook
```

You should now be good to go and run all the cells.
